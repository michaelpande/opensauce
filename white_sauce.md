## 1
Melt 50g of butter in a pot / boiler. Make sure you don't burn it.
Then move the pot from the heat source.

## 2
- Add 4 flat tablespoons of flour and stir until completely blended.
Now you carefully have to add enough flour spoon by spoon until it
is just past the point of being liquid. This should not require much more than an additional 1-2 tablespoons

- Add 1/2th teaspoon of salt. Regardless of salted or unsalted butter.
- Add 1/3th teaspoon of pepper
- Add 1/5th teaspoon of nutmeg

## 3
Add 250ml of milk, and stir until perfectly blended. It will seem to be too liquid, but will solidify until perfect consistency with heat.

## 4
- Move pot to heat source and stir on medium heat until you have your preferred consistency.
- Move your pot from the heat source.

## 5 - Be careful!
Very carefully add more salt by tasting.\n
This will make or break your sauce. If you start getting uncertain, stop adding more salt.
Salt can always be added later when serving.
Do not for any reason exceed 1.5 teaspoons at this step.

## Finished!
You should now have a good Béchamel sauce!
