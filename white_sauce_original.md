## Before you start
- Don't burn the sauce. It's better to use less heat and more time, the result is the same.
- If you are not happy with the consistency when finished - either heating it longer to make it thicker or add more milk to make it thinner.

## 1
Melt 50g of butter in a pot / boiler. Make sure you don't burn it.
Then move the pot from the heat source.

## 2
- Add 1/2th teaspoon of salt. Regardless of salted or unsalted butter.
- Add 1/3th teaspoon of pepper.
- Add 1/5th teaspoon of nutmeg.
- Carefully add enough flour and stir (1 tablespoon at the time, max 6) until it is just past the point of being liquid.

## 3
Add 250ml of milk, and stir until perfectly blended. It will seem to be too liquid, but will solidify until perfect consistency with heat.

## 4
- Move pot to heat source and stir on medium heat until you have your preferred consistency.
- Move your pot from the heat source.

## 5 - Salt
**Remember: This will make or break your sauce.** <br />
Do not for any reason exceed 1.5 teaspoons at this step.<br />
If you start getting uncertain, then stop.<br />
Salt can always be added later when serving.

- Carefully add salt while tasting.

## Finished!
You should now have a good Béchamel sauce!
